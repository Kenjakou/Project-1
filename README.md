This document, titled "Optimized Searching and Sorting: Modified Binary Search and Merge Sort Hybrid," discusses a hybrid algorithm that combines a modified version of binary search with merge sort. The purpose of this study is to enhance the efficiency of searching and sorting operations for large datasets. Here's a breakdown:

Problem Context:
Binary search is an efficient searching algorithm, but it requires the data to be pre-sorted.
Merge sort is a stable and efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets.

Proposed Solution:
The study integrates a modified binary search algorithm (as proposed by Ankit R. Chadha in 2014) with merge sort to address the dependency of binary search on sorted data.

Key Features:
The modified binary search evaluates the first, last, and middle indices at each iteration, optimizing its performance in worst-case scenarios.
Merge sort is employed to ensure the data is sorted efficiently before applying the search algorithm.

Results:
The hybrid approach demonstrates better performance compared to traditional methods (standard binary search combined with merge sort) in terms of execution time for varying data sizes.

Applications:
This algorithm is particularly useful for large datasets where sorting and searching are frequent operations, offering improved scalability and efficiency.
Limitations:

And so the study focuses on numeric, one-dimensional arrays only.
